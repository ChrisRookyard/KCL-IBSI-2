function waveletFilters = prepare_wavelet_filters(waveletType,level)

% *************************************************************************
% PREPARE_WAVELET_FILTERS: returns a cell array of wavelet filters in 3D
% *************************************************************************
%
% INPUTS
%
%   wavelet type â€” the type of wavelet to be used
%
%   level - and the level to go to
%
% OUTPUTS
%
%   waveletFilters, i-by-1 cell array, where i is the level, and in each
%   entry:
%       a cell with an entry for each combination of filters(8), and each 
%       entry for that will be 4-D, with the rotations going along the 4th 
%       dimension within each cell entry.
%
% NOTE
%
%   this function is used to make producing 3D kernels a one-off, since it
%   takes a while. For 2D, the filters do not need to be produced in
%   advance, and the "filter_undecimated_separable_wavelet_2D" function can
%   be called with the waveletType.

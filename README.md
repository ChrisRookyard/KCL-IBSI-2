# KCL-IBSI-2
This repository holds the contribution of the Cancer Imaging Department at King's College London (KCL) to chapter 2 of the Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI). [@ChrisRookyard](https://github.com/ChrisRookyard) is the developer of this project, and much of this code will also be on the [Cancer Imaging Department's GitHub repository](https://github.com/CancerImagingKCL).

The [IBSI](https://theibsi.github.io/) is an international collaborative effort to standardise image processing and analysis. To date, there have been two chapters: the first was on standardising radiomics measures, to which the KCL Cancer Imaging Department also contributed, and the second was on standardising convolutional image filters. The paper for the former is [here](https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020191145), and for the latter, [here](https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.231319). This repository holds the code for our contribution to the second chapter. 

Chapter 2 of IBSI consisted of three phases: two benchmarking phases, and a validation phase. Here is provided the code, written in Matlab, for all filters that achieved a consensus in the first two phases â€” details of the filters, and the parameters tested, can be found in the [IBSI chapter 2 manual](https://theibsi.github.io/documentation/). 

There are also two "pipeline" scripts (pipeline_script_phase_1 and pipeline_script_phase_2 for phase 1 and 2, respectively), designed to demonstrate a walkthrough of each of the first two phases, or indeed, to be used as a basis upon which to use any of the core filtering functions. These scripts are organised into Matlab cells that should be fairly self-explanatory, with each cell corresponding to particular benchmarking tests, as documented in the IBSI chapter 2 manual. In the first phase, whole response maps were compared, and in the second phase, radiomic features were calculated after filtering, and compared (see the [uploads section](https://theibsi.github.io/uploads/) of the IBSI website). Each pipeline script generates these results, either as saved, compressed NIfTI files (for phase 1) or as a .csv file of statistics (for phase 2), so standardisation can be compared independently. 

The scripts require the [digital phantom images](https://github.com/theibsi/data_sets/tree/master/ibsi_2_digital_phantom) (phase 1), the [CT image](https://github.com/theibsi/data_sets/tree/master/ibsi_2_ct_radiomics_phantom) and the [submission .csv file](https://ibsi.radiomics.hevs.ch/assets/IBSI-2-Phase2-Submission-Template.csv) (phase 2) for benchmarking; download or clone these separately.
